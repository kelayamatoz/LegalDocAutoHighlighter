Service-Specific Terms

Bitbucket-specific terms

Effective starting: April 28, 2014

Your use of Bitbucket is subject to the terms of the Atlassian Customer Agreement (the “Agreement”) as well as the following additional terms. Any capitalized terms used but not defined below have the meanings in the Agreement.

1. Repositories. Data that you upload to Bitbucket are stored in “repositories.” You designate whether the repositories are public (meaning that anyone coming to the Bitbucket website can view them) or private (meaning that access to those repositories will be limited to those who have permission to access the repositories). For each public repository that you maintain, you must indicate the license under which you are making the contents of the repository available to others, as well as the license under which you will accept contributions to your repository.

2. Storage Rules. We do not set pre-defined storage limits on Your Data in Bitbucket. However, we do enforce parameters described in the Bitbucket documentation to ensure that you do not use Bitbucket in a way that consumes a disproportionate amount of system resources (CPU’s, memory, disk space, bandwidth, etc.) or that would adversely impact the performance or operation of Bitbucket for other Bitbucket users. Similarly, since Bitbucket is designed to be used as a source code repository, we reserve the right to remove any other content (such as music or video), particularly if the content is consuming a disproportionate amount of storage. Please note that, since we do not maintain access to your repositories, any removal of Your Data under Section 7.8 (Removals and Suspension) of the Agreement means removal of the entire repository in which the offending data resides, not just the offending portions.

3. Accessing Repositories. If you are accessing code in someone else’s repository, you should carefully read all the licenses applicable to that repository before using or contributing any code. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL CODE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH BITBUCKET IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ACCOUNT OWNER CONTROLLING THE PARTICULAR REPOSITORY. ATLASSIAN IS NOT THE LICENSOR OF ANY THIRD PARTY CODE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH BITBUCKET AND TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUCH CODE.

4. Granting Permissions. Be careful about granting permissions to your repositories. Once you grant such permissions, we will not be able to prevent those users from taking the actions allowed under those permissions, even if you don’t approve of those actions. Be especially careful about granting administrative access to your repositories, as some of those actions may be irreversible. For example, if you grant someone permission that allows them to move content in your repository to another account, we will not be able to reach into that other user’s account without their permission to recover the data, as we are not in a position to arbitrate disputes among our users. In that case, your only recourse may be requesting a takedown under our policy regarding Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations or pursuing legal action against the other user directly.

HipChat-specific terms

Effective starting: May 27, 2014

Your use of HipChat is subject to the terms of the Atlassian Customer Agreement (the “Agreement”) as well as the following additional terms. Any capitalized terms used but not defined below have the meanings in the Agreement.

1. Responsibility for User Consent. Your administrators may have the ability to access, monitor, use, or disclose data available to HipChat users within the users' HipChat accounts (including chats, chat history, and file attachments). You will obtain and maintain all required consents from your HipChat users to allow: (a) you to access, monitor, use, and disclose this data, (b) Atlassian to provide you with the ability to do so, and (c) Atlassian to provide the HipChat service to you.

2. Chat History. By using HipChat, you consent to the storage of your chat history by us. Your chat history is saved as the default option. You may change your options through the product.

Cloud-specific terms

Effective starting: April 28, 2014

Your use of Atlassian Cloud is subject to the terms of the Atlassian Customer Agreement (the “Agreement”) as well as the following additional terms. Any capitalized terms used but not defined below have the meanings in the Agreement.

Bamboo. Bamboo Cloud requires Amazon's Elastic Cloud Hosted Service (“EC2”) in order to operate. EC2 allows you to use Elastic Bamboo, which dynamically creates and runs remote agents in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. You must register with Amazon Web Hosted Services (“AWS”) in order to access EC2. To be clear, EC2 is not part of the Hosted Services, and fees paid to Atlassian do not include fees for EC2. If you register for EC2, you will be charged directly by AWS and will be solely responsible for payment of all fees to AWS. Additional information about Bamboo Cloud and EC2 is available at the following sites:
